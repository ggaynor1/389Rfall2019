In the situation that the current ECU firmware has multiple security problems which could pose a danger to both the car and the consumer, I believe the best course of action is to immediately alert my superiors. Since I was given the responsibility of auditing the firmware, my job was simply to find any existing issues. It is up to my superiors to make the decision on how to go about fixing these issues. However, if my company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release, at this point, I would alert a consumer watchdog. By doing this, I can remain anonymous, and although it would most likely be against company policy to release information of this manner, it would be the most ethical decision as it considers the safety of the general public. Opponents may argue that it would be unethical to release sensitive information without the consent of your superiors, however; if they are refusing to act, it is in society's best interest if they were made aware of this information. Some may also aruge that you would not be responsible for any harm that results if you did nothing. However, this is not true because by failing to disclose information that you are aware that could endanger occupants, you are indirectly the cause of the harm.
