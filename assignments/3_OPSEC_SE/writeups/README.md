###Part 1

To social engineer the specified information out of Eric Norman, I would pose as a network administrator for Digital Cloud, LLC, the hosting company that his company website is under. If I am pretending to be someone with authority, it would be easier to get information from Eric Norman. I think a good way to get this information would be telling Eric Norman that we are migrating our servers and we just need some information to make the process smoother. Starting with more general questions would help Eric Norman be more comfortable down the line when it comes to personal questions.

###Part 2

The specific vulnerabilities that Eric Norman could fix would be using a stronger username and password combination, closing server ports, and not leaving hints as HTML comments. If Eric Norman used a stronger username and password combination, it would be harder to get into the backend server in the firstplace. Password management is another way to help secure his information. Also, if he left the hints out of the HTML code, attackers would not be aware that it would be that easy to get into the backend server. Lastly, closing server ports using firewalls would make it more difficult for attackers to access the backend server.
